                seismological evidence for an active fault beneath the Tehri dam based on mapping of the earthquake distribution has been observed, study presents initial results suggestive of linkage between the seismicity near the Tehri dam, and loading and unloading of the reservoir.

                The dams themselves, as structures, do not cause earth quakes.It is the increase in water behind the dam, pressing down on the crust. This causes pressure in the fissures and micro- racks under the reservoir and in the nearby surroundings. 
                </p>
                <p><Dot />
                As the pressure of all this extra water increases, it acts like a lubricant on rocks that are already under tectonic strain, but which are unable to slip by the friction of the previously unlubricated rock surfaces.

                   The state creates a system where it can own water, sell water, and make money from water sales through the construction of dams. As capitalism and government privatization advance, the state now benefits from selling the water administration to private corporations rather than managing and selling the resource directly

                   By considering selling the Tehri Hydro Power Project to the National Thermal Power Corporation Limited, the state seeks to gain profit through the sale, while simultaneously boosting India's GDP by allowing NTPCL to profit from water sales.

                    After construction of the dam,winters became longer and the rainfall became irregular.Instead, what they get are long periods of foggy weather.The reservoir generates fog and mist up in the air.

                    <p> <Dot/>
                    That in turn falls as dew on his crops which leads to pests and blight.Because of the pest attack and failing agricultural production, many of the locals were considering migration.

                Rise in mean temperature may have been due to heat up of water, as in large reservoir, the water surface is exposed to the sun for longer periods.

                Water velocity of river ranged between (2.4-0.60 m -s ) which was observed almost nil in all the seasons after impoundment. 
                </p>
                <p> < Dot/>
                Dissolved oxygen also increased in all seasons after impoundment of river. An increase by 1 mg-l in summer while by 0.9, 0.7 and 0.2 mg -l in monsoon, autumn and winter seasons respectively.
                </p>
                <p> < Dot/>
                The increase in dissolved oxygen and absence of free CO 2 in the lentic water maybe due to increased photosynthesis by high phytoplanktonic growth

                When organic matter (accumulated at the bottom of the reservoir) gets degraded by aerobic and anaerobic process,there is an excess release of GHG into the atmosphere. The increase in GHGs emissions is also due to nutrient loading, enhanced bacterial activity, and decomposition of labile organic carbon.
                </p>
                <p> <Dot />
                A small amount of GHGs is released from the reservoir through the bubbling, degassing, but a significant amount is released through diffusion from water surface as well as when the water is passed through the turbines and spillways
                </p>
                <p> <Dot />
                GRAT (Beta version) was developed by UNESCO/IHA in 2012 to estimate the vulnerability of freshwater reservoirs to GHG emission.

                After the dam completion regions main economic activity agriculture was most adversely affected  due to issues of submergence, seasonal inundations, degradation, lack of water availability and reoccurring landslides.
                </p>
                <p> <Dot />
                Prior to dam  construction, the agricultural terraces were located towards the river margins, were fertile, and well drained . Crop intensity and production was enough to support village economies efficiently producing surplus for the whole year.
                </p>
                <p> <Dot />
                Other subsidiary activities like animal husbandry, fishing, transportation of local goods etc have also been affected due to disruption of transport networks.
                </p>
                <p> <Dot />
                Villagers are forced to practice agriculture in upper regions of the valley with low quality soil which does not produce efficiently for the whole year.
                </p>
                <p> <Dot />
                Therefore the villages which were self sustained at one point of time have become more dependent on the government owned Public distribution shops, and employment schemes for their survival.
