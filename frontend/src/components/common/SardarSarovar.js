                    Construction of the Project resulted in direct migration of many people, these people had not received any economic compensation for vacating the area.
                    Most of the people to be migrated by the development of this project were tribal encroachers on the state land and are not legal owners of that land.  Despite the fact that this would turn tribal people who hold their land by customary usage into landless oustees, both the states of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh chose to abide by the Tribunal's ruling regarding oustees, which stated that only those with formal title to land, and their adult sons would be given land.

                    They finally left with no land which is a financial disaster for these people because their primary source of income is the land, and their primary skill is understanding their local environment. Many people did not receive any compensation for the lost land or for the other resources, such fruit trees, that the Sardar Sarovar Project devastated.

                    Even for individuals who are covered by the resettlement and rehabilitation portion of the development project, their financial security was sometimes compromised since there wasn't enough land provided, and the land that was provided was of lower quality.
                    Furthermore, the resettlement and rehabilitation policies did not take into account various forms of economic subsistence, such as gathering, pastoralism, or fishing. Also, the levels of economic productivity which result from local environmental and cultural knowledge has been, for the most part, ignored.</p>

                    Farmers are also set to benefit, but the distribution of water property rights among the discussed farmers is not equitable.
                    Despite the fact that both areas are vulnerable to drought conditions, Farmers who use capital intensive techniques and are at the primary end of the command area are given more priority than the farmers in the non-primary areas to receive the irrigation benefits first.

                    The resultant large reservoirs, submerged forest, and changes to downstream siltation patterns could create an environment where there is increased incidence of existing diseases and introduction of new diseases into an area in the following ways.
                    The local population is at danger since the dam construction requires labour, frequently provided by migrant workers who can bring diseases to which the local population is not immune.
                    </p>

                    <p> < Dot/> Furthermore, the enormous reservoir creates a tremendous amount of fog leading to increased respiratory diseases and the reduced visibility due to the fog results in increased accidents.
                    The poor treatment of the catchment area, the submergence of standing forest, and in general the failure to implement various environmental safeguard measures will result in eutrophication and other processes that will degrade the water quality in the reservoir which will further result in a number of negative health impacts.

                    <p> <Dot/>
                    The periphery of the reservoir will increase humidity over distances of three to five Kilometers and also construction of the rock-filled dykes, extending the malaria transmission season and lengthening mosquito life cycles. In the next 15 to 20 years, it's possible that the ponds will result in a significant increase in the incidence of Japanese encephalitis.
                    The adivasi system of medicine which is based on the use of locally available plants is under siege due to the depletion of the forest. Because access to the forest has been completely cut off, the system of indigenous medicine is destroyed, and highly detailed, finely tuned knowledge is lost forever.

                    The direct effects of resettlement on health are also evident. Lack of fodder has caused animal populations to decline, which has reduced the amount of protein available for human consumption. The variety of fruits and vegetables harvested from the forest, along with meat and fish, have both been eliminated from the diet. Primary Health Centers at the resettlement locations were understaffed and frequently too far away for the majority of people to reach them.

                        The diseases most common in the district are those of the digestive and respiratory system, malaria and typhoid, disease of eyes and skin and TB. Epidemics of cholera, chicken pox, measles and influenza are also prevalent in varying degrees.

                    In order to determine how much water should be released or not, neither the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited nor the Gujarati government have conducted any scientific research.

                    Lack of freshwater has severely impacted the brackish water formation (formed due to mixing of freshwater and saline water), which is an ideal breeding ground for fishes. The lack of fish breeding has seriously impacted the fishing community,freshwater is not being released into the river from the Sardar Sarovar Project.

                    <p> <Dot/> Due to the altered hydrodynamics of sweet and salty water, Alia Bet, one of the most biodiverse estuary islands in the Narmada Basin and a home for fish reproduction, has almost completely disappeared.

                    Many of the resettled people were compensated with land in far off regions, which forced them to move out of their homeland, where their families had thrived for many decades. When relocated to a different region, the resettled population had to learn new languages and adjust to the new culture, which could take years to get used to.
